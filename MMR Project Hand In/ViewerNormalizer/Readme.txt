Instructions:

- The header and source files are all in this folder. The main program is 'Application.cpp'. It needs to be run in 64 bit (64x) mode.

- The additional libraries are in the folder 'Dependencies'.

- The original (remeshed) sample data base is in the folder 'DB'. This folder needs to be in the source directory of the program.

- The file 'cube.off' is a simple unit sized cube which is only present for visualization / debug purposes. (but still quite nice to view and draw)

- The program will use the console to ask the user to either view a file or to normalize a data base.

- When using the viewer, pressing 'd' on the keyboard allows for different drawing modes. Using the mouse allows to rotate / translate / zoom.

- When using the normalization, the program performs all of the necessary steps to normalize (including PCA and flipping) the data base and stores them in a new folder 'Normalized_DB'.
